## monad

* functor (_函子_) -> which are things that can be mapped over using a normal function - fmap is used for that.
* applicative functor -> tought us that when our Functors themselves contain functions and we want them applied to the values contained in other Functors, Applicatives come to the rescue - and bring theirs friends pure and <*>.
* monoid (_幺半群_) -> model a special type of relationship involving binary functions and their identity values.
* monad (_单子_) -> computation carry with a context all the way going.

play with monad have fun :)
